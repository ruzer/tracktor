- **Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

### 2. Deployment Guide Redirect  
- **From:** `/deployment.md`
- **To:** `/developer-guide/deployment/`
- **Method:** Client-side JavaScript redirect with 3-second delay
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

## Link Updates Completed

- Updated quick start links to use proper VitePress routing
- All links validated and working

### 2. README.md
- Updated contributing link to point to new consolidated location
- Changed from `app/docs/contributing.md` to `app/docs/developer-guide/contributing/`

### 3. Navigation Configuration

- Updated all relative links to use correct directory structure

## Validation Tools Created

- **Purpose:** Validates internal markdown links across key documentation files
- **Features:** 
  - Handles relative and absolute links
  - Checks for file existence
  - Supports VitePress routing conventions

### 2. Redirect Testing Script
- **File:** `.vitepress/scripts/test-redirects.js`
- **Purpose:** Validates that redirect pages are properly configured
- **Features:**
  - Checks for redirect script presence

  - Confirms redirect functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Redirect Method
Used client-side JavaScript redirects instead of server-side redirects because:
- VitePress is a static site generator
- Client-side redirects work in all deployment scenarios
- Provides user feedback during redirect process
- Maintains SEO-friendly redirect pages

### Redirect Code Pattern
```javascript
<script setup>
import { onMounted } from 'vue'

onMounted(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = '/target-location/'
  }, 3000)
})
</script>
```

### Link Standardization
- Removed `.md` extensions from internal links
- Used VitePress routing conventions
- Ensured all links work in both development and production builds

## Validation Results

### Link Validation
- ✅ All primary navigation links working
- ✅ All redirect pages properly configured
- ✅ Main documentation structure validated

### Build Testing
- ✅ VitePress build completes successfully
- ✅ Preview server starts without errors
- ✅ Redirect functionality confirmed

## Files Modified

1. `app/docs/.vitepress/config.mjs` - Navigation updates
2. `app/docs/contributing.md` - Added redirect functionality
3. `app/docs/deployment.md` - Added redirect functionality  
4. `app/docs/index.md` - Fixed link formats
5. `app/docs/README.md` - Updated contributing link
6. `app/docs/user-guide/index.md` - Fixed broken references

## Files Created

1. `app/docs/.vitepress/scripts/validate-links.js` - Link validation tool
2. `app/docs/.vitepress/scripts/test-redirects.js` - Redirect testing tool
3. `app/docs/.vitepress/REDIRECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

1. Monitor redirect usage and update analytics if needed
2. Consider removing redirect pages after sufficient time has passed
3. Continue monitoring for any additional broken links
4. Update any external references to old URLs

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test link validation
node app/docs/.vitepress/scripts/validate-links.js

# Test redirect configuration
node app/docs/.vitepress/scripts/test-redirects.js

# Build documentation
cd app/docs && npm run build

# Preview documentation
cd app/docs && npm run preview
```

All redirect and link update requirements have been successfully implemented and validated.
