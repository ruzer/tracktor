# First Setup

Configure Tracktor for your first use after installation. This guide will walk you through the essential setup steps to get you started with vehicle tracking.

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have:

- ✅ Successfully installed Tracktor
- ✅ Verified the application is running at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ A modern web browser ready

## Step 1: Initial Access

1. **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **You'll see the login screen** - This is your gateway to Tracktor

The login screen features:

- Clean, modern interface
- Tracktor branding and logo
- PIN input field for authentication
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Step 2: PIN Authentication Setup

Tracktor uses PIN-based authentication to secure your vehicle data while keeping access simple and fast.

### Creating Your PIN

On your first visit, you'll need to create a PIN:

1. **Enter a 4-6 digit PIN** in the input field
   - Choose something memorable but secure
   - Avoid obvious combinations like "1234" or "0000"
   - Consider using a pattern that's meaningful to you

2. **Confirm your PIN** by entering it again
   - This ensures you've entered it correctly
   - Both entries must match exactly

3. **Click "Set PIN"** to create your authentication
   - Your PIN is securely hashed and stored locally
   - The original PIN is never stored in plain text

### PIN Security Best Practices

- **Choose a unique PIN** - Don't use PINs from other accounts
- **Make it memorable** - You'll need to enter it each time you access Tracktor
- **Keep it private** - Don't share your PIN with others
- **Consider length** - Longer PINs (5-6 digits) are more secure

### Logging In (Subsequent Visits)

After setting up your PIN:

1. **Enter your PIN** in the login field
2. **Click "Login"** to access the dashboard
3. **Your session will remain active** until you log out or close the browser

> **Forgot Your PIN?** If you forget your PIN, you'll need to reset the application data. See the [troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md#forgotten-pin) for recovery options.

## Step 3: Initial Configuration

Once logged in, you'll see the main dashboard. Let's configure some basic settings before adding your first vehicle.

### Dashboard First Look

The dashboard provides an overview of:

- **Vehicle summary** - Total vehicles and their status
- **Recent fuel logs** - Latest refueling activities
- **Maintenance reminders** - Upcoming service needs
- **Document status** - Insurance and certificate renewals
- **Analytics charts** - Fuel efficiency and cost trends

Since this is your first time, most sections will be empty - that's normal!

### Theme Configuration

Customize the appearance to your preference:

1. **Locate the theme toggle** in the top navigation bar
2. **Click to switch** between light and dark modes
3. **Your preference is automatically saved** and will persist across sessions

**Light Mode:** Clean, bright interface ideal for daytime use
**Dark Mode:** Easy on the eyes, perfect for low-light environments

### Browser Compatibility Check

Ensure optimal experience by verifying:

- **JavaScript is enabled** in your browser
- **Cookies are allowed** for the Tracktor domain
- **Local storage is available** for saving preferences
- **Modern browser features** are supported

### Understanding the Interface

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the main interface elements:

#### Top Navigation
