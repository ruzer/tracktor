## Overview

Fuel tracking in Tracktor provides:

- **Detailed fuel purchase logging** with automatic efficiency calculations
- **Real-time fuel economy monitoring** and trend analysis
- **Cost tracking and spending analysis** across time periods
- **Comparative analytics** for multiple vehicles
- **Historical data** for long-term insights and patterns

## Understanding Fuel Tracking

### Key Concepts

#### Fuel Efficiency Calculation

Tracktor automatically calculates fuel efficiency using the distance traveled between fuel-ups:

- **Distance = Current Odometer - Previous Odometer**
- **Efficiency = Distance ÷ Fuel Amount**
- **Units:** Miles per gallon (MPG) or Kilometers per liter (KM/L)

#### Data Relationships

- **Odometer readings** must be sequential and increasing
- **Date tracking** maintains chronological order
- **Vehicle association** links all fuel data to specific vehicles
- **Cost analysis** tracks spending patterns over time

## Adding Fuel Entries

Log every fuel purchase to build comprehensive efficiency and cost data.

### Step-by-Step Fuel Logging

#### 1. Access Fuel Tracking

- **Navigate to Fuel tab** in the main interface
- **Select your vehicle** if you have multiple vehicles
- **Click "Add Fuel Log"** or "Log Fuel" button

#### 2. Enter Fuel Purchase Details

**Required Information:**

**Date of Purchase**

- **Format:** Standard date picker or manual entry
- **Validation:** Cannot be future date
- **Best Practice:** Log fuel purchases on the same day when possible

**Current Odometer Reading**

- **Format:** Integer value (whole numbers only)
- **Validation:** Must be greater than previous reading
- **Importance:** Critical for accurate efficiency calculations
- **Tips:** Round to nearest mile/kilometer for consistency

**Fuel Amount**

- **Format:** Decimal number (e.g., 12.5 gallons or 47.3 liters)
- **Validation:** Must be greater than 0
- **Precision:** Use pump display amount for accuracy
- **Units:** Gallons, liters, or your preferred unit

**Total Cost**

- **Format:** Decimal number (e.g., 45.67)
- **Validation:** Must be greater than 0
- **Currency:** Uses your system's default currency
- **Include:** Total amount paid, including taxes

**Optional Information:**

**Notes**

- **Purpose:** Additional details about the fuel purchase
- **Examples:**
  - Gas station name and location

  - Special circumstances (highway vs. city driving)
  - Fuel additives or treatments used
- **Length:** Up to 500 characters

#### 3. Data Validation and Verification

Before saving, Tracktor validates:

- **Odometer progression** - New reading must be higher than previous
- **Date logic** - Purchase date must be reasonable
- **Positive values** - Fuel amount and cost must be greater than zero
- **Data consistency** - Checks for obvious errors or outliers

#### 4. Save the Fuel Log

1. **Review all entered information** for accuracy
2. **Check calculated efficiency** if displayed
3. **Click "Save" or "Add Fuel Log"**
4. **Confirmation** - Entry appears in your fuel log list

### Example Fuel Log Entry

```
Date: March 15, 2024
Vehicle: 2020 Toyota Camry LE
Odometer: 45,580 miles
Fuel Amount: 12.3 gallons
Total Cost: $42.15
Notes: Shell station on Highway 101, Regular unleaded
Calculated Efficiency: 28.5 MPG (based on previous entry)
```

### Best Practices for Fuel Logging

#### Consistency Guidelines

- **Log every fuel purchase** - Don't skip entries for accurate tracking
- **Use same measurement units** - Stick to gallons or liters consistently
- **Record immediately** - Log purchases soon after filling up
- **Include all costs** - Use total amount paid, not just fuel cost

#### Accuracy Tips

- **Read odometer carefully** - Ensure accurate mileage recording
- **Use pump totals** - Record exact amounts from fuel pump display
- **Note fuel type** - Different grades affect efficiency calculations
- **Consider driving conditions** - Note highway vs. city driving in notes

## Fuel Efficiency Calculations

Tracktor automatically calculates and displays fuel efficiency metrics to help you monitor vehicle performance.

### How Efficiency is Calculated

#### Basic Calculation Method

1. **Distance Traveled** = Current Odometer - Previous Fuel Log Odometer
2. **Fuel Efficiency** = Distance Traveled ÷ Fuel Amount Added
3. **Cost per Distance** = Total Cost ÷ Distance Traveled

#### Example Calculation

```
Previous fuel log: 45,230 miles, 11.8 gallons
Current fuel log: 45,580 miles, 12.3 gallons

Distance = 45,580 - 45,230 = 350 miles
Efficiency = 350 miles ÷ 12.3 gallons = 28.5 MPG
Cost per mile = $42.15 ÷ 350 miles = $0.120 per mile
```

### Efficiency Metrics Displayed

#### Miles Per Gallon (MPG) / Kilometers Per Liter (KM/L)

- **Current efficiency** for the most recent fuel-up
- **Average efficiency** over selected time periods
- **Best/worst efficiency** records for comparison
- **Trend indicators** showing improvement or decline

#### Cost Metrics

- **Cost per mile/kilometer** for each fuel-up
- **Average cost per distance** over time periods
- **Total fuel spending** by month, quarter, or year
- **Price per gallon/liter** trends and comparisons

#### Performance Indicators

- **Efficiency trends** - Visual indicators of improving or declining efficiency
- **Seasonal variations** - How efficiency changes with weather/driving conditions
- **Comparative metrics** - How your vehicle compares to similar vehicles

### Factors Affecting Efficiency

#### Driving Conditions

- **Highway vs. City** - Highway driving typically shows better efficiency
- **Traffic conditions** - Stop-and-go traffic reduces efficiency
- **Weather impact** - Cold weather and headwinds affect fuel economy
- **Load and passengers** - Additional weight reduces efficiency
