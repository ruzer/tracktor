## Feedback and Iteration

### Providing Feedback

#### Constructive Comments

```markdown
# ‚úÖ Good feedback

Consider using a more descriptive variable name here. Instead of `data`,
perhaps `vehicleData` would make the code more readable.

# ‚úÖ Good feedback with suggestion

This function is doing multiple things. Consider splitting it into:

1. `validateVehicleData()` for validation
2. `saveVehicle()` for persistence

# ‚ùå Poor feedback

This is wrong.

# ‚ùå Poor feedback

Bad code.
```

#### Comment Categories

Use these prefixes to categorize feedback:

- **üêõ Bug**: Potential bugs or logical errors
- **üí° Suggestion**: Improvements or alternative approaches
- **‚ùì Question**: Clarification needed
- **üîß Nitpick**: Minor style or preference issues
- **üö® Blocker**: Must be fixed before merge
- **üí≠ Thought**: General observations or ideas

#### Code Suggestions

Use GitHub's suggestion feature for small changes:

````markdown
```suggestion
const vehicleCount = vehicles.length;
```
````

````

### Addressing Feedback

#### Response Guidelines
- **Acknowledge**: Respond to all feedback, even if you disagree
- **Explain**: Provide reasoning for your approach when questioned
- **Implement**: Make requested changes or explain why you won't
- **Ask Questions**: Seek clarification when feedback is unclear
- **Be Gracious**: Thank reviewers for their time and input

#### Making Changes
```bash
# Make changes based on feedback
git add .
git commit -m "address review feedback: improve error handling"

# Push updates to the same branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
````

#### Resolving Conversations

- **Mark as Resolved**: Only the comment author should resolve conversations
- **Explain Resolution**: Comment on how the feedback was addressed
- **Request Re-review**: Ask for re-review after significant changes

## Merge Requirements

### Merge Criteria

All of the following must be satisfied before merge:

#### Automated Checks

- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] No merge conflicts with target branch
- [ ] Branch is up to date with target branch
- [ ] All required status checks pass

#### Review Requirements

- [ ] At least one approving review from a maintainer

### Merge Strategies

#### Squash and Merge (Preferred)

Use for most feature branches to maintain clean history:

```bash
# Creates a single commit with all changes
git merge --squash feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Merge Commit

Use for significant features or when preserving commit history is important:

```bash
# Preserves individual commits
git merge --no-ff feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Rebase and Merge

Use for small, clean commits that add value to history:

```bash
# Replays commits without merge commit
git rebase main
git merge --ff-only feature/your-feature-name
```

## Special Cases

### Hotfixes

For critical production issues:

1. **Create from Main**: Branch directly from `main`
2. **Minimal Changes**: Keep changes as small as possible
3. **Expedited Review**: Request immediate review
4. **Fast-Track Merge**: Can be merged with single approval
5. **Follow-up**: Create issue for proper fix if needed

```bash
# Hotfix branch naming
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-patch
git checkout -b hotfix/database-connection-fix
```

### Documentation-Only Changes

For documentation updates:

1. **Simplified Review**: Focus on content accuracy and clarity
2. **Fast Approval**: Can be approved by any team member
3. **Direct Merge**: Can be merged immediately after approval
4. **Batch Updates**: Multiple doc changes can be batched together

### Dependency Updates

For package updates:

1. **Automated PRs**: Dependabot creates automated PRs
2. **Security Updates**: Prioritize security-related updates
3. **Testing Required**: Ensure all tests pass with new versions
4. **Breaking Changes**: Review for breaking changes in major updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main

# Resolve conflicts and continue
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Failed CI Checks

```bash
# Run checks locally to debug
npm run lint
npm run check
npm test
npm run build

# Fix issues and push updates
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI check failures"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Outdated Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```
