# Deployment

Comprehensive deployment guides and configurations for Tracktor in production environments.

## Deployment Options

- **[Docker Deployment](./docker.md)** - Containerized deployment (recommended)
- **[Manual Deployment](./manual-deployment.md)** - Traditional server deployment
- **[Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md)** - Configuration reference
- **[Production Considerations](./production-considerations.md)** - Production best practices

## Quick Start

For most users, **Docker deployment** is the recommended approach as it provides:

- Consistent environment across different systems
- Easy dependency management
- Simplified deployment process
- Better isolation and security

## Deployment Overview

Tracktor can be deployed in several ways depending on your infrastructure and requirements:

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Best for most production deployments. Provides containerized environment with all dependencies included.

**Pros:**

- Easy to deploy and manage
- Consistent across environments
- Includes all dependencies
- Good for scaling

**Cons:**

- Requires Docker knowledge
- Slightly more resource overhead

### Manual Deployment

Traditional deployment directly on a server. Good for custom environments or when Docker isn't available.

**Pros:**

- Direct control over environment
- Lower resource overhead
- Easier debugging

**Cons:**

- More complex setup
- Dependency management required
- Environment consistency challenges

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Tracktor, ensure you have:

### For Docker Deployment

- Docker installed on target system
- Docker Compose (optional but recommended)
- Basic Docker knowledge

### For Manual Deployment

- Node.js v18 or higher
- npm package manager
- Process manager (PM2 recommended)
- Reverse proxy (nginx recommended)

## Security Considerations

When deploying Tracktor:

1. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
2. **Configure proper firewall rules** to restrict access
3. **Set strong environment variables** for security
4. **Regular updates** of dependencies and system packages
5. **Backup strategy** for database and configuration

## Monitoring and Maintenance

For production deployments:

- **Set up logging** for application and system events
- **Monitor resource usage** (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Regular backups** of SQLite database
- **Update strategy** for security patches
- **Health checks** for service availability

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your deployment method** based on your requirements
2. **Review [Production Considerations](./production-considerations.md)** for best practices
3. **Follow the specific deployment guide** for your chosen method
4. **Configure [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md)** appropriately
5. **Test the deployment** thoroughly before going live

For detailed instructions, see the specific deployment guides linked above.
