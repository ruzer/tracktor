# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the Tracktor application documentation to create a comprehensive, well-organized, and maintainable documentation system. The current documentation in `app/docs` using VitePress needs to be restructured to eliminate redundancy, provide extensive coverage for both users and developers, and include placeholders for manual updates where needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user of Tracktor, I want comprehensive and well-organized documentation so that I can quickly understand how to use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a clear navigation structure separating user and developer content
2. WHEN a user reads the documentation THEN the system SHALL present information without redundancy across different sections
3. WHEN a user needs specific feature information THEN the system SHALL provide detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots
4. WHEN a user wants to understand the application's capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide complete feature coverage with examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to Tracktor, I want detailed technical documentation so that I can understand the codebase, architecture, and development processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation with request/response examples
2. WHEN a developer needs API specifications THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger/OpenAPI specifications for all backend APIs
3. WHEN a developer needs to understand the architecture THEN the system SHALL provide detailed technical diagrams and component explanations
4. WHEN a developer wants to contribute THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions, coding standards, and contribution guidelines
5. WHEN a developer needs to deploy the application THEN the system SHALL provide multiple deployment scenarios with detailed steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want a single source of truth for all documentation so that I can avoid duplication and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure all references point to the single authoritative source
2. WHEN content exists in multiple places THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into one location with appropriate cross-references
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL have clear placeholders indicating where manual updates are needed
4. WHEN documentation is restructured THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility through redirects or clear migration paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a documentation contributor, I want clear indicators of where manual intervention is needed so that I can efficiently update documentation when features change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL clearly mark sections requiring manual updates with standardized placeholders
2. WHEN features are modified THEN the system SHALL provide templates for updating corresponding documentation sections
3. WHEN API endpoints change THEN the system SHALL have placeholders indicating which documentation sections need review
4. WHEN new screenshots are needed THEN the system SHALL have clear indicators of where visual content should be updated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user or developer, I want the documentation to be easily searchable and navigable so that I can quickly find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for information THEN the system SHALL provide effective search functionality across all documentation
2. WHEN navigating the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear breadcrumbs and section organization
3. WHEN accessing documentation on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive and user-friendly interface
4. WHEN following links THEN the system SHALL ensure all internal references are valid and up-to-date

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the documentation structure to be maintainable and scalable so that it can grow with the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL have a clear documentation template and structure to follow
2. WHEN the project grows THEN the system SHALL support easy reorganization without breaking existing links
3. WHEN multiple contributors work on documentation THEN the system SHALL have clear style guides and conventions
4. WHEN documentation becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL have mechanisms to identify and flag stale content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Tracktor APIs, I want interactive API documentation so that I can test endpoints and understand request/response formats easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger/OpenAPI interactive documentation
2. WHEN a developer needs to test API endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow direct testing from the documentation interface
3. WHEN API schemas change THEN the system SHALL automatically update the Swagger documentation
4. WHEN a developer needs example requests THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive examples for all endpoints
5. WHEN API authentication is required THEN the system SHALL clearly document authentication methods and provide test capabilities
